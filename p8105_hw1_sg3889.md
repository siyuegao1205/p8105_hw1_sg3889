# Problem 1

Load the `penguins` dataset.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

## Brief Summary

Look at the dataset using `view()`.

``` r
View(penguins)
```

Look at a brief summary of the dataset using `summary()`.

``` r
summary(penguins)
```

Discussion:

-   The variables involved in the `penguins` dataset are **species**,
    **island**, **bill_length_mm**, **bill_depth_mm**,
    **flipper_length_mm**, **body_mass_g**, **sex**, and **year**. For a
    brief summary of this dataset, there are 3 speicies of penguins,
    including Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo. The penguins come from 3
    unique islands, including Biscoe, Dream, and Torgersen. The penguins
    in this dataset have bill lengths ranging from 32.1mm to 59.6 mm,
    bill depths ranging from 13.1 mm to 21.5 mm, flipper lengths ranging
    from 172 mm to 231 mm, and body masses ranging from 2700 g to
    6300 g. There are 165 female and 168 male penguins in the dataset,
    and all of the penguins were born between 2007 and 2009.  
-   The dataset has 344 rows and 8 columns.  
-   The mean flipper length for the penguins in the dataset is 200.92
    mm.

## Scatterplot

Now I will make a scatterplot of `flipper_length_mm` on y-axis and
`bill_length_mm` on x-axis, with colored points by `species`.

``` r
ggplot(
  penguins,
  aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)
  ) +
  geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_sg3889_files/figure-gfm/scatterplot-1.png)<!-- -->

Export the scatterplot to the working directory.

``` r
ggsave("scatterplot_flipper_bill_length_by_species.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
```

# Problem 2

Create a data frame.

``` r
p2_df =
  tibble(
    var_norm = rnorm(n = 10),
    var_logical = var_norm > 0,
    var_character = c("alopecia", "anxiety", "asthma", "chills", "deafness", "fever", "headache", "infection", "nausea", "rash"),
    var_factor = c("severe", "severe", "mild", "moderate", "mild", "severe", "moderate", "mild", "mild", "mild")
  )
```
